# Docker-compose for InfluxDB and Grafana

Docker-compose for InfluxDB and Grafana

## Tools

* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data driven culture.
* [InfluxDb](https://www.influxdata.com/) is an open-source time series database developed by InfluxData. It is written in Go and optimized for fast, high-availability storage and retrieval of time series data in fields such as operations monitoring, application metrics, Internet of Things sensor data, and real-time analytics. It also has support for processing data from Graphite.
* [Chronograf](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/chronograf/) is the user interface component of InfluxDataâ€™s TICK Stack. It allows you to quickly see the data that you have stored in InfluxDB so you can build robust queries and alerts. It is simple to use and includes templates and libraries to allow you to rapidly build dashboards with real-time visualizations of your data.
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)  is a computer program that performs operating-system-level virtualization also known as containerization.
